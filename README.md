Usage
--------
**Login to Thingiverse:** 

Click on the Thingiverse button and enter your user data. You will also be asked to grant the app some permissions.

**Browse your things and collections**

Use the three tabs of the Thingiverse window - "My Things", "Liked" and "Collections" - to browse and access the respective things.

**Open a file**

Selecting a thing in the left pane will display all its associated files that match your current filter settings in the right pane. To open a file, simply double click it or select it and press the "Open File" button.

**Search for things**

Use the search tab in the Thingiverse window to search for a project on Thingiverse.

**Use filters**

At the top right of the Thingiverse window, you can select filters to only display things that match certain criteria.
You can choose to only display things that include at least one file with a supported file extension or to only display things that have a tag related to laser cutters. Supported file extensions and tags can be customized in the preferences.

Note: The filters are added to each other, i.e. if you select both, only things will be displayed that match *both* criteria.

**Change search filter settings**

Open the preferences and click on the Thingiverse tab. There you can enter supported file extensions and tags you want to filter for.

**I made one**

Select a thing and click the "I made one" button to open the "I made one"-window. You can use either the VisiCam or the camera of your computer to take a photo of the thing you made. On the left, there is a live preview, on the right side is a textfield to enter a description. Clicking the "publish" button will publish an "I made one" post with the current picture and description to Thingiverse.
